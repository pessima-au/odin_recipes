<p>Okra soup contains sliced okra fruit, meat, crayfish, seasoning cubes, salt, pepper, etc.

    I like this soup because it is very easy to prepare and one of likely the cheapest.
    
    You can use frozen fish, Okra and some other ingredients to prepare the soup.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Serving 4x2 | Preparation time:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Sliced okra (a medium-sized bowl full)</li>
        <li>Stockfish head (medium-sized)</li>
        <li>1 kg of chicken</li>
        <li>5 chombo peppers</li>
        <li>2 scotch bonnet peppers</li>
        <li>500g mackerel</li>
        <li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>200ml Red (palm) oil</li>
        <li>half cup of grounded crayfish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the okra and set it aside in a bowl, the trader in most Nigerian markets can assist you with slicing the okra, but you can also try using a kitchen knife, I like to slice Okra myself, although there is no harm in using the help of the market women.

            Remove center seeds from the shombo, combine with scotch bonnet and blend or pound using a mortar and pestle. Also, blend or grind the crayfish.
            
            I used just 1kg (2.2lb) of chicken and 500g of fish for this okra soup.
            
            I like to parboil meat with lots of spices and then use very little while making the real soup.</li>

        <li>Wash the fish/chicken and season with a half teaspoon of salt, two seasoning cubes, a cup of water, and half a cup of sliced onions.
            Allow it to boil together for 10-15 minutes. Remove them while leaving the stock in the pot.</li>

        <li>Add the stockfish to the boiling pot, one more cup of water, and cook for about 10 minutes till they are soft for consumption.

            Add two cups of water.</li>
        <li>Introduce 200ml of palm oil, add the crayfish, pepper/shombo, and salt to taste.

            Let it boil for 8 minutes. Add the cooked chicken/fish and allow simmering for three more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced okra and stir. Drop the cooked mackerel fish on top.

            Allow simmering for 3-4 minutes, and you are done with this delicious soup.
            
            You can serve ofe okro with eba, fufu or pounded yam.</li>
    </ol>
