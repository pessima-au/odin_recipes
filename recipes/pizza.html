<p>Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing from Naples. When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>3 cups bread flower</li>
    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <li>2 cans (14-1/2 ounces each) diced tomatoes, drained</li>
    <li>8 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>20 fresh basil leaves, roughly torn</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>

    <li>
        In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl, combine the oil, sugar, salt and 1 cup flour; beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
    </li>

    <li>
        Turn onto a floured surface; knead for 6-8 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
    </li>

    <li>
        Punch dough down; divide in half. Roll each portion into a 13-in. circle. Transfer to 2 greased 14-in. pizza pans; build up edges slightly. Cover with a clean kitchen towel; let rest for 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spoon tomatoes over dough. Top with cheese, oregano, basil, pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Drizzle with oil. Bake at 450° for 15-20 minutes or until crust is golden brown.
